# Simple Backtesting

This repository contains the code for the backtest of a very simple trading strategy: buying/selling NASDAQ based on its price relative to a moving average (as specified by the user). The purpose of this (short) project was not to create a successful trading strategy. Instead, it was intended to help me think through and decipher the logic that one would go through when formulating a backtest for a trading strategy. Going forward, this will be a useful reference point when creating and backtesting more complicated (quantitative/sysetmatic macro) strategies.
